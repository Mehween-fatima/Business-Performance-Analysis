💡 Key Business Insights

A limited number of products contribute significantly to overall profit.

Some states generate high sales but low or negative profit, indicating pricing or cost inefficiencies.

Excessive discounting negatively impacts profit margins.

Sales show noticeable seasonal trends useful for forecasting.

📌 Business Recommendations

Prioritize high-margin products in marketing and inventory planning.

Reassess pricing and logistics in loss-making regions.

Control discount strategies for low-margin categories.

Use seasonal patterns for demand forecasting.
