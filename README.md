## 📈 Key Insights

- Strong sales do not always translate to high profit across categories.
- Some states show high revenue but low or negative profit, indicating pricing or cost issues.
- High discount levels correlate with reduced profit margins.
- Seasonal trends in sales can guide future planning.

---

## 📌 Business Recommendations

- Focus marketing and inventory on high-margin products.
- Reassess pricing strategy for low-profit regions.
- Reduce excessive discounts on low profitability categories.
- Use seasonal trends to plan promotions and stock.

## 🧮 Example DAX Measures

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Sales])

Total Profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])

Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)
```
